# Facet Coverage

> Multi-stakeholder test coverage tracking for JavaScript/TypeScript projects

Facet Coverage lets teams write requirements in Markdown and automatically tracks whether tests cover them. Different stakeholders (product, compliance, UX, security) can write their requirements naturally, and the tool tracks coverage across all perspectives.

## Quick Start

```bash
bun add -d @facet-coverage/core
bunx facet generate    # Generate structures from markdown
bunx facet analyze     # Run coverage analysis
bunx facet serve       # Start live dashboard
```

## How It Works

1. Stakeholders write requirements as Markdown headings in `facets/*.md` files
2. Run `facet generate` to create `.facet/structure.json` and TypeScript constants
3. Tests import constants and call `facet(Facets.SOME_REQUIREMENT)` to link
4. Run `facet analyze` to see coverage across all requirements
